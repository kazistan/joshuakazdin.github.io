ESG investing is an approach to asset selection that includes environmental, social, and governance criteria in the asset screening and selection process. At GYL, we have overseen ESG-screened investments for many years, and we are excited to announce our new ESG solution. By combining our proprietary “best in class” asset allocation and investment screening process with core principles of responsible investing, our ESG solution will give investors the opportunity to align their investments with the things that matter most to them.
