excerpt: 'Characteristics of companies associated with climate change predict excess equity returns. We show that firms with lower carbon emission intensities—with carbon emissions being a key component of the Paris Accord—have high excess returns. We present evidence that firms with lower carbon emissions have higher productivity, and that the lower carbon intensities may reflect greater firm efficiencies. A portfolio of firms with a higher proportion of LEED certified buildings also exhibits high excess returns. Such companies also contemporaneously exhibit higher return on assets. Portfolios constructed with the carbon emission intensities and the LEED certified buildings signals are only weakly correlated to a traditional quality factor. We discuss how climate change themed measures of firm efficiency may drive value for sustainably focused investors.'

Characteristics of companies associated with climate change predict excess equity returns. This article shows that companies with low-carbon-emission intensities—with carbon emissions being a key component of the Paris Agreement—have high excess returns. The authors present evidence that companies with low carbon emissions have high productivity and that low carbon intensities may reflect greater company efficiencies. A portfolio of companies with a high proportion of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-certified buildings also exhibits high excess returns. Such companies also contemporaneously exhibit high return on assets. Portfolios constructed with carbon emission intensity and LEED-certified building signals are only weakly correlated with a traditional quality factor. The authors further discuss how climate change–themed measures of company efficiency may drive value for sustainably focused investors.
